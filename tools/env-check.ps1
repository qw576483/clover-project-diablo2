#  env-check.ps1 -- environment gate for any 3D project (run BEFORE the first Play,
#  and again before drawing any conclusion about frame rate / "the game is laggy").
#
#  One question: does this machine actually have a WORKING hardware 3D adapter?
#  Exit 0 = usable, 1 = software rendering / broken GPU (STOP: fix the machine first,
#  do NOT go looking for performance bugs in the code), 2 = could not decide.
#
#  Why this exists (2026-09-20, real incident):
#    A "the game is stuck at 1 fps" report took 6 Play sessions to trace. The machine
#    had a DISABLED discrete GPU (Code 22) and Unity was falling back to the CPU
#    software rasterizer (Microsoft Basic Render Driver, ~255ms/frame). The root cause
#    was visible in one command -- and the elapsed time was blamed on the project.
#    Seeing software rendering means every frame-time number on that machine is void.
#
#  This file must stay ASCII-only (Windows PowerShell 5.1 parses .ps1 as ANSI when the
#  file has no UTF-8 BOM). Do NOT match localized display names ("Basic Display
#  Adapter" is Chinese on zh-CN Windows) -- match PNPDeviceID prefixes and error codes,
#  which are language independent.
#
#  Usage:
#    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\env-check.ps1
#    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\env-check.ps1 -Root <projectRoot>
